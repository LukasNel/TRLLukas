## Test Results

### Test Case 1

**Query:** What was Apple's stock price last week?

**Thinking Process:**
Okay, the user is asking for Apple's stock price last week. Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out the date range for "last week." Since today is October 25, 2023, last week would be from October 16 to October 20, 2023. But wait, maybe I should check if the stock market was open those days. Oh right, the stock market is closed on weekends, so the weekdays would be Monday to Friday. So October 16 to 20 is a Monday to Friday, which is a full trading week.

Next, I need to use the stock_price tool. The parameters required are ticker, start_date, end_date, and interval. The ticker for Apple is 'AAPL'. The start_date would be '2023-10-16' and end_date '2023-10-20'. The interval should be daily ('1d') to get each day's price.

Wait, but when using yfinance, the end_date is exclusive. So to include October 20, the end_date should be set to October 21. Let me adjust that. So start_date '2023-10-16' and end_date '2023-10-21' to capture up to the 20th.

Then, after fetching the data, I need to present the closing prices for each day. The tool returns a DataFrame with 'Date' as the index and 'Close' price. I'll extract those and format them into a readable response for the user.

I should also check if there's any missing data, like if a holiday occurred during that week. But in October 2023, there are no market holidays that I know of. Columbus Day is October 9, which is the previous week. So the data should be available.

Let me write the Python code to fetch the data using the stock_price function. Then, I'll print out the relevant dates and closing prices. If there's an error, like if the data isn't available, the tool will throw an exception, which I need to handle. But since the user is asking about last week, which is recent, the data should be accessible.

So the code would be:

```python
# Fetch Apple's stock data for last week (October 16 to October 20, 2023)
data = stock_price('AAPL', '2023-10-16', '2023-10-21', '1d')

# Extract the closing prices
closing_prices = data[['Close']]

# Format the output
print("Apple's daily closing stock prices last week (October 16-20, 2023):")
print(closing_prices)
```text
Successfully executed. Output from code block:
Apple's daily closing stock prices last week (October 16-20, 2023):
Price            Close
Ticker            AAPL
Date                  
2023-10-16  177.419647
2023-10-17  175.861069
2023-10-18  174.560577
2023-10-19  174.183380
2023-10-20  171.622162

```None
Apple's daily closing stock prices from October 16 to October 20, 2023, were as follows:

- **October 16**: $177.42
- **October 17**: $175.86
- **October 18**: $174.56
- **October 19**: $174.18
- **October 20**: $171.62

The stock experienced a downward trend during this week, decreasing by approximately $5.80 from Monday to Friday.

### Test Case 2

**Query:** Compare Tesla and Microsoft's financial performance over the last quarter

**Thinking Process:**
Okay, I need to compare Tesla and Microsoft's financial performance over the last quarter. Let me start by figuring out what data I need. Financial performance can be assessed through income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. Since the user mentioned the last quarter, I should look at quarterly financials.

First, I'll need to get the income statements for both companies. That will show revenues, expenses, and profits. Then, the balance sheets to check assets and liabilities. Cash flow statements will help understand their liquidity. 

I'll use the company_financials tool for each company. The parameters are ticker, statement_type ('income', 'balance', 'cash'), and period ('quarterly'). Let me make sure to get the latest quarter data. 

Wait, but when using yfinance, sometimes the data might not be up to date. Also, the last quarter could be Q1 2024 if we're in April now. Let me check the current date. Assuming today's date is after April 2024, the last quarter would be Q1 2024. But I need to confirm the data availability.

I'll start by fetching Tesla's quarterly income statement. Then Microsoft's. Then do the same for balance sheet and cash flow. Once I have all the data, I can compare key metrics like revenue, net income, operating cash flow, etc.

Wait, but the user might want a summary of the most important metrics. Let me list the key figures: total revenue, net income, operating income, gross profit, EPS. For balance sheet, total assets, liabilities, equity. Cash flow: operating, investing, financing activities.

I should structure the data into a comparison table. Also, check if there are any significant changes or trends. Maybe calculate growth rates compared to previous quarters. But the user specified the last quarter, so maybe just the latest numbers.

Let me start coding. First, get Tesla's income statement. Using company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'quarterly'). Then Microsoft's ('MSFT', 'income', 'quarterly'). Same for balance and cash. Then extract the latest quarter's data.

Wait, the financial statements might have multiple quarters. I need to take the most recent one. So in pandas, after fetching the data, I can sort by the index (which is the date) and take the last row.

Also, handle possible exceptions if data isn't available. But the user said to assume the tools handle that. So proceed.

Once I have all the data, I can create a DataFrame or a dictionary to compare the two companies side by side. Then present the key metrics in a readable format.

Let me write the code step by step. First, fetch each financial statement for both companies. Then extract the latest quarter's data. Then compare the numbers.

To compare Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft's (MSFT) financial performance for the last quarter, I'll analyze their income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows. Here's the comparison:

```python
# Get quarterly financial data for both companies
import pandas as pd

# Tesla financials
tsla_income = company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]
tsla_balance = company_financials('TSLA', 'balance', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]
tsla_cash = company_financials('TSLA', 'cash', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]

# Microsoft financials
msft_income = company_financials('MSFT', 'income', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]
msft_balance = company_financials('MSFT', 'balance', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]
msft_cash = company_financials('MSFT', 'cash', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]

# Create comparison DataFrame
comparison = pd.DataFrame({
    'Metric': ['Revenue', 'Net Income', 'Gross Profit', 'Operating Income',
               'Total Assets', 'Total Liabilities', 'Operating Cash Flow',
               'Free Cash Flow'],
    'Tesla': [tsla_income['Total Revenue'], tsla_income['Net Income'],
             tsla_income['Gross Profit'], tsla_income['Operating Income'],
             tsla_balance['Total Assets'], tsla_balance['Total Liabilities'],
             tsla_cash['Total Cash From Operating Activities'],
             tsla_cash['Free Cash Flow']],
    'Microsoft': [msft_income['Total Revenue'], msft_income['Net Income'],
                 msft_income['Gross Profit'], msft_income['Operating Income'],
                 msft_balance['Total Assets'], msft_balance['Total Liabilities'],
                 msft_cash['Total Cash From Operating Activities'],
                 msft_cash['Free Cash Flow']]
})

# Format numbers in millions
comparison['Tesla'] = comparison['Tesla'].apply(lambda x: f"${x/1e6:,.0f}M")
comparison['Microsoft'] = comparison['Microsoft'].apply(lambda x: f"${x/1e6:,.0f}M")

Failed. Please try another strategy. Code execution failed at line 'tsla_income = company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'quarterly').iloc[-1]' due to: Exception: Access to financial data not allowed beyond cutoff date: 2025-05-12
``````


Okay, the user wants to compare Tesla and Microsoft's financial performance over the last quarter. I tried using the company_financials tool with 'quarterly' period, but it threw an exception about the cutoff date. Hmm, maybe the data for the most recent quarter isn't available yet or the tool has a cutoff date that's preventing access. Let me check the current date. Oh, right, the cutoff is 2025-05-12, so maybe the latest quarterly data isn't accessible through this tool.

Wait, perhaps the tool is designed to not allow data beyond a certain date. The error message says "Access to financial data not allowed beyond cutoff date: 2025-05-12". That seems like a placeholder date. Maybe the actual data available is older. So, maybe the user needs to use annual data instead. Let me adjust the code to fetch annual data and then extract the latest quarter from there. But wait, annual financials are yearly, so maybe the last quarter's data isn't directly available. Alternatively, maybe the tool's 'quarterly' period is not working, so I should try using the stock_price tool to get revenue or other metrics from the last quarter's stock data. But stock_price gives price data, not financials like revenue or net income.

Alternatively, perhaps the company_financials tool for quarterly data is not available, so I need to use annual data and then look at the most recent annual report, which might include the latest quarter's figures. Wait, no, annual reports are yearly, so they wouldn't have quarterly breakdowns. Maybe the user needs to look at the latest available quarterly data that's within the cutoff date. Let me check what the latest available data is. If the cutoff is 2025-05-12, maybe the latest quarterly data is from Q1 2025. But if the current date is before that, perhaps the data isn't available yet. Alternatively, maybe the tool is mock and the error is a placeholder. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code is trying to access the latest quarter, which is beyond the cutoff. So instead of using .iloc[-1] to get the most recent quarter, maybe I should specify a specific date range that's within the allowed cutoff. But how to know the cutoff? The error message says the cutoff is 2025-05-12. So if today's date is after that, the tool would block it. But if the user is asking for the last quarter (assuming current date is in 2023, for example), maybe the data is available. Wait, but the error message suggests that the code is trying to access data beyond the cutoff. So perhaps the latest available data is before 2025-05-12, and the code is trying to get data after that. 

Wait, maybe the company_financials tool's 'quarterly' data is not available, so the code should instead use 'annual' and then compare the latest annual reports. But the user specifically asked for the last quarter. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the tool is not functioning correctly for quarterly data, so the solution is to use annual data and mention that quarterly data isn't available. But the user's request is for the last quarter, so that's a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the error is due to the way the data is being accessed. Maybe the .iloc[-1] is causing an issue. Let me check the structure of the data returned by company_financials. If it's a DataFrame with dates as index, maybe the latest date is beyond the cutoff. So instead of taking the last row, maybe filter the data to include only rows where the date is before the cutoff. But how to know the cutoff date? The error message says the cutoff is 2025-05-12. So perhaps the code should fetch the data up to that date. 

Wait, but the user's question is about the last quarter. If the current date is within the allowed cutoff, then the last quarter's data should be accessible. But if the code is trying to get data beyond the cutoff, that's the problem. So maybe the solution is to adjust the code to fetch the latest available quarter before the cutoff. For example, if the cutoff is 2025-05-12, then the latest quarter might be Q1 2025, and the code should fetch that. But how to specify that in the code? 

Alternatively, perhaps the company_financials tool is not the right tool to use for quarterly data, and the user should instead use the stock_price tool. But stock_price gives price data, not financial metrics. 

Wait, maybe the issue is that the code is using the company_financials tool with 'quarterly' period, which is not allowed. So the solution is to switch to using annual data and then compare the latest annual reports. But that wouldn't answer the user's question about the last quarter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the tool's 'quarterly' period is not implemented, and the user should instead manually calculate quarterly figures from annual data. But that's not feasible. 

Hmm. The error message indicates that the code is trying to access data beyond the cutoff date. So perhaps the latest available quarterly data is before the cutoff, and the code is trying to get data after that. To fix this, maybe the code should explicitly specify the date range for the last quarter that's within the cutoff. For example, if the cutoff is 2025-05-12, then the last quarter would be Q1 2025 (ending March 31), and the code should fetch data up to that date. 

But how to adjust the code to do that? The company_financials tool doesn't take start and end dates, only period. So maybe the tool is designed to return the latest available data, but if that data is beyond the cutoff, it throws an error. Therefore, the solution is to use annual data instead. 

Alternatively, maybe the user should be informed that quarterly data isn't available due to the cutoff and proceed with annual data. But the user specifically asked for the last quarter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should handle the exception and inform the user that the latest quarterly data isn't available. But the user wants a comparison. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that the code is using .iloc[-1], which gets the latest entry, but that entry's date is beyond the cutoff. So instead, the code should filter the data to only include entries before the cutoff date. For example:

tsla_income = company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'quarterly')
tsla_income = tsla_income[tsla_income.index <= '2025-05-12'].iloc[-1]

But the code doesn't have access to the cutoff date unless it's provided. The error message mentions the cutoff date, so perhaps the code should adjust based on that. But since the cutoff is given as 2025-05-12 in the error, maybe the latest available data is before that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use annual data and compare the latest annual reports, noting that quarterly data isn't accessible. 

So, modifying the code to use annual data instead of quarterly:

tsla_income = company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'annual').iloc[-1]
...

But then the user asked for the last quarter, not annual. So this would be a mismatch. 

Alternatively, maybe the user's last quarter refers to the most recent quarter available, which might be part of the annual data. But annual financials are yearly, not quarterly. 

Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. The user wants quarterly data, but the tool is throwing an error. The error message suggests that the data being accessed is beyond the cutoff. So perhaps the solution is to inform the user that the latest quarterly data isn't available due to the cutoff and proceed with annual data, or adjust the code to fetch data within the allowed dates. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should use the stock_price tool to get revenue or other metrics, but that's not possible because stock_price only gives price data. 

Wait, perhaps the financial statements for the last quarter are not available via the company_financials tool, so the user has to rely on annual data. In that case, the assistant should explain that quarterly data isn't accessible and proceed with annual comparisons. 

So, modifying the code to use annual data:

```python
# Get annual financial data for both companies
tsla_income = company_financials('TSLA', 'income', 'annual').iloc[-1]
tsla_balance = company_financials('TSLA', 'balance', 'annual').iloc[-1]
tsla_cash = company_financials('TSLA', 'cash', 'annual').iloc[-1]

msft_income = company_financials('MSFT', 'income', 'annual').iloc[-1]
msft_balance = company_financials('MSFT', 'balance', 'annual').iloc[-1]
msft_cash = company_financials('MSFT', 'cash', 'annual').iloc[-1]

# Create comparison DataFrame...

``````

 then the user's question about the last quarter isn't addressed. The assistant would need to explain that quarterly data isn't available and provide annual data instead. 

Alternatively, maybe the cutoff date is in the future, and the code is trying to access future data. So the solution is to adjust the code to fetch the latest available quarter before the cutoff. 

But without knowing the exact cutoff date in advance, it's hard to code that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should catch the exception and handle it gracefully. For example:

try:
    tsla_

### Test Case 3

**Query:** What is the current market cap of Amazon?

**Thinking Process:**
Okay, the user is asking for the current market cap of Amazon. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that market cap is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the number of outstanding shares. So I need both the latest stock price and the number of shares outstanding for Amazon.

To get the stock price, I can use the stock_price tool. Let me set the ticker as 'AMZN', the start_date as today's date minus a few days to ensure there's data, maybe a week ago. The end_date would be today. The interval can be '1d' for daily data. That should give me the latest closing price.

Wait, but if today is a weekend or a holiday, the market might be closed. So maybe using the most recent available data is better. The stock_price function should handle that by returning the last available data within the date range.

Once I have the stock price, I need the number of shares outstanding. For that, the company_financials tool can be used. The balance sheet (statement_type 'balance') should have the information about shares. Since market cap uses the diluted shares outstanding, I should look for 'Diluted Average Shares Outstanding' in the income statement or maybe 'Shares Outstanding' in the balance sheet. Wait, the balance sheet might have 'Ordinary Shares Number' which represents the number of shares outstanding. But sometimes companies report shares in different line items, so I need to check the correct key in the financial data.

Alternatively, maybe the income statement's 'Diluted Average Shares' is used for EPS calculations, but for market cap, the current shares outstanding is needed. The balance sheet's 'Ordinary Shares Number' under shareholders' equity section is the right place. Let me check the balance sheet for the most recent period.

So, using company_financials with statement_type 'balance' and period 'quarterly' to get the latest data. Then extract the 'Ordinary Shares Number' from the balance sheet. Multiply that by the latest stock price to get the market cap.

Wait, but sometimes the shares outstanding might be reported in thousands or another denomination. Need to check the units. Also, the balance sheet might have the shares as a separate line item. Let me make sure to get the correct value.

Alternatively, maybe the info from yfinance's get_info() method would have the market cap directly, but since the tools provided don't include that, I have to calculate it using the available tools.

So steps:

1. Fetch the latest stock price for AMZN.
2. Fetch the latest balance sheet to get shares outstanding.
3. Multiply the two to get market cap.

Let me code this step by step.

First, get the stock price. Let's set start_date to a week ago to ensure data exists. For example, if today is 2023-10-30, start_date could be 2023-10-23. The end_date is today. The interval is '1d'. Then take the last closing price.

Then, get the balance sheet. Using company_financials('AMZN', 'balance', 'quarterly'). The most recent quarter's data will have the shares outstanding. Extract 'Ordinary Shares Number' from the balance sheet.

Multiply the shares by the stock price to get market cap. Then format the result in billions for readability.

Wait, but sometimes the shares outstanding might be in thousands. Let me check the data structure. For example, if the balance sheet returns a DataFrame where one of the rows is 'Ordinary Shares Number' and the value is in millions or thousands, that would affect the calculation. Need to ensure that the units are correct. For example, if the value is 10,000,000 shares, then multiply by the stock price. But if it's in thousands, then multiply by 1,000 first.

Alternatively, maybe the data is already in absolute numbers. Let me check the output of company_financials. Suppose the balance sheet returns a DataFrame where the index includes 'Ordinary Shares Number' and the value is the actual number of shares. Then, using that value directly.

So, code steps:

1. Get stock data:
   stock_data = stock_price('AMZN', '2023-10-23', '2023-10-30', '1d')
   latest_close = stock_data['Close'].iloc[-1]

2. Get balance sheet:
   financials = company_financials('AMZN', 'balance', 'quarterly')
   shares = financials.loc['Ordinary Shares Number'].iloc[-1]

3. Calculate market cap:
   market_cap = latest_close * shares

But wait, the balance sheet's 'Ordinary Shares Number' might be in thousands. For example, if the value is 10,000, that's 10 million shares. Need to check the units. Alternatively, maybe the data is in actual shares. Let me check the possible structure.

Alternatively, maybe the shares outstanding can be found in the income statement's 'Diluted Average Shares' for the trailing twelve months. But the user wants the current market cap, which uses the current shares outstanding, not the average. So balance sheet is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the company's financials have a line item called 'Shares Outstanding' which is the current number. Let me check.

If the company_financials returns a DataFrame where the index includes 'Ordinary Shares Number', then that's the number. Otherwise, maybe 'Share Issued' or similar. This might vary by company, so perhaps the code needs to search for the correct line item.

Alternatively, maybe the number of shares can be found in the company's info, but since the tools don't provide that, we have to rely on the financial statements.

Another approach: sometimes the market cap is directly available via yfinance's info, but since the tools don't include that, we have to calculate it.

Assuming that the balance sheet's 'Ordinary Shares Number' is the correct figure, proceed.

So, code:

# Fetch the latest stock price
stock_data = stock_price('AMZN', '2023-10-23', '2023-10-30', '1d')
latest_price = stock_data['Close'].iloc[-1]

# Fetch the latest balance sheet to get shares outstanding
balance_sheet = company_financials('AMZN', 'balance', 'quarterly')
shares_outstanding = balance_sheet.loc['Ordinary Shares Number'].iloc[-1]

# Calculate market cap
market_cap = latest_price * shares_outstanding

# Convert to billions for readability
market_cap_billion = market_cap / 1e9

print(f"Amazon's current market cap is approximately ${market_cap_billion:.2f} billion.")

But wait, there's a possibility that the 'Ordinary Shares Number' is not the correct line item. For example, Amazon's balance sheet might list 'Common Stock Shares Outstanding' or similar. If the code throws an error because 'Ordinary Shares Number' is not found, then I need to adjust the code to find the correct line item.

Alternatively, check the columns of the balance_sheet DataFrame to see what line items are available. For example, maybe 'Common Stock' or 'Shares Outstanding' is the correct key.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should look for 'Shares Outstanding' in the balance sheet. Let me adjust the code to check for that.

But since I can't see the actual data structure, I have to make an educated guess. If the code fails, the error message will indicate which line item is missing, and I can adjust accordingly.

Another consideration: the shares outstanding might be in thousands. For example, if the balance sheet reports 10,000, that's 10 million shares. So need to multiply by 1,000. But how to know? If the value seems too low (e.g., 10,000 shares for Amazon, which is impossible), then multiply by 1,000. But Amazon has billions of shares outstanding. So if the value is around 10 billion, then it's correct. If the code returns a market cap that's way off, then adjust the shares by multiplying by 1e3 or 1e6.

Alternatively, check the units in the financial statements. For example, if the financials are presented in millions, then the shares number would be in millions as well. But that's unlikely. Usually, shares are reported in absolute numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the company_financials tool returns the data in actual numbers, not scaled. So if the balance sheet shows 10,000,000 shares, it's 10 million.

But without seeing the actual data, it's a bit of a guess. However, given the tools available, this is the approach to take.

So, proceed with the code as outlined. If the code runs without errors and returns a reasonable market cap (e.g., around $1.3 trillion as of October 2023), then it's correct. Otherwise, adjust based on errors.

To determine Amazon's current market capitalization, we need the latest stock price and the number of outstanding shares. Here's the step-by-step solution:

```python
# Fetch the latest stock price for Amazon
stock_data = stock_price('AMZN', '2023-10-23', '2023-10-30', '1d')
latest_close = stock_data['Close'].iloc[-1]

# Fetch the latest quarterly balance sheet to get shares outstanding
balance_sheet = company_financials('AMZN', 'balance', 'quarterly')
shares_outstanding = balance_sheet.loc['Ordinary Shares Number'].iloc[-1]

# Calculate market capitalization
market_cap = latest_close * shares_outstanding

# Format the result
market_cap_billion =

**Status:** âœ… Success

### Test Case 4

**Query:** Analyze the stock price trends of NVIDIA over the past month

**Thinking Process:**
Okay, let's tackle the user's request to analyze NVIDIA's stock price trends over the past month. First, I need to figure out the date range. Since today's date isn't provided, I'll assume the current date is around the time when the answer was given, which is October 2023. But wait, the user mentioned "past month," so I should calculate the start and end dates accordingly. Let's say the end date is today, and the start date is one month prior. For example, if today is 2023-10-10, then the start date would be 2023-09-10.

Next, I need to fetch the stock price data. The tool available is stock_price, which takes ticker, start_date, end_date, and interval. The user wants the past month, so daily data would be appropriate. The interval should be '1d'. The ticker for NVIDIA is NVDA.

I should write a Python code block using the stock_price function with these parameters. Once the data is retrieved, I can load it into a pandas DataFrame. Then, I need to analyze the trends. Key metrics would include the starting price, ending price, highest and lowest prices during the period, and the overall percentage change. Also, calculating moving averages, like a 7-day MA, could help identify trends. Volatility measures, such as standard deviation of daily returns, would be useful too.

Visualization might help, but since the user hasn't explicitly asked for charts, maybe a summary of key statistics is sufficient. I should check if the data is available; sometimes weekends or holidays might have missing data, but yfinance usually handles that by not including those days. Also, need to handle any exceptions if the dates are invalid or data isn't available, but the code should include a try-except block for that.

Wait, the user's example answer used a start date of '2023-09-10' and end date of '2023-10-10', which is exactly one month. Let me confirm that the data retrieval works for that period. Then, compute the daily returns, check the trend (upward, downward, volatile), and note any significant events if there are big jumps or drops, but maybe that's beyond the scope without news data.

So the steps are: fetch data, compute metrics, analyze trends, and present findings in a clear summary. Also, mention any limitations, like the analysis being purely historical and not accounting for external factors.

To analyze NVIDIA's (NVDA) stock price trends over the past month, I'll retrieve daily price data and compute key metrics. Here's the analysis:

```python
# Get stock data for the past month (2023-09-10 to 2023-10-10)
nvda_data = stock_price("NVDA", "2023-09-10", "2023-10-10", "1d")

# Convert to DataFrame and calculate metrics
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(nvda_data).reset_index()

# Calculate daily returns and moving averages
df['Daily Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change() * 100
df['7D MA'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=7).mean()

# Get key statistics
start_price = df['Close'].iloc[0]
end_price = df['Close'].iloc[-1]
monthly_change = ((end_price - start_price)/start_price * 100).round(2)
volatility = df['Daily Return'].std().round(2)
high = df['High'].max()
low = df['Low'].min()

print(f"""
**NVDA Stock Analysis (2023-09-10 to 2023-10-10)**
- Starting Price: ${start_price:.2f}
- Ending Price: ${end_price:.2f}
- Monthly Change: {monthly_change}%
- Monthly High: ${high:.2f}
- Monthly Low: ${low:.2f}
- Average Daily Volatility: {volatility}%

Okay, let's see. The user tried to run some Python code to analyze NVIDIA's stock over the past month, but there was an error. The error message says there's a TypeError related to formatting a Series. Hmm.

Looking at the code, they used stock_price to get the data and converted it into a DataFrame. Then they calculated some metrics like start_price and end_price by taking df['Close'].iloc[0] and iloc[-1]. Wait, maybe the issue is that df['Close'] is a pandas Series, and when they try to format it with .2f, it's causing a problem because the values might not be scalar. Or perhaps the data from stock_price isn't structured as expected.

Wait, when they call stock_price, the returned data might be a list of dictionaries or a DataFrame with a different structure. Maybe the 'Close' column is not a single value but something else. Let me check the stock_price function's documentation. The tool says it returns an object, which is probably a DataFrame. But when they do df = pd.DataFrame(nvda_data).reset_index(), maybe the columns aren't named as expected. For example, if the data from stock_price is already a DataFrame, converting it again might cause issues. Or perhaps the dates are in the index, and reset_index() moves them into a column, but the 'Close' column is correctly accessed.

Wait, the error occurs during the print statement. The variables start_price, end_price, etc., might be pandas Series or NaN instead of single floats. Let me check how they're calculated. start_price = df['Close'].iloc[0]. If df['Close'] is a Series, then iloc[0] should give the first element as a scalar. But maybe in some cases, if the DataFrame is empty or the data isn't retrieved properly, these variables could be NaN or not exist. Alternatively, maybe the data wasn't fetched correctly because the dates were invalid. The user used "2023-09-10" to "2023-10-10". Wait, but if today's date is before 2023-10-10, the end_date might be in the future, causing the stock_price function to throw an error. But the user's code execution failed at the print statement, not earlier. So maybe the data was retrieved, but the variables are not scalars.

Wait, the error message says "unsupported format string passed to Series.__format__". That suggests that one of the variables being formatted (like start_price) is a pandas Series instead of a single number. How could that happen? Let's see: df['Close'].iloc[0] should be a single value. Unless the DataFrame is empty, but then iloc[0] would throw an error. Alternatively, maybe the stock_price function returns multiple entries for the same date, making df['Close'] have multiple values per row. Or perhaps the data structure is different. For example, if the stock_price returns a DataFrame where each row is a dictionary with 'Date' and other columns, but when converted to a DataFrame, the structure is nested.

Alternatively, maybe the data from stock_price is a list of dictionaries, each with 'Date', 'Open', 'High', etc. When creating the DataFrame, perhaps the columns are not as expected. Let me think: if nvda_data is a list of dictionaries, then pd.DataFrame(nvda_data) would have each key as a column. So 'Close' would be a column of floats. Then df['Close'].iloc[0] should be a float. But if for some reason, the 'Close' column is a Series of objects or something else, that could cause issues. Alternatively, maybe the data wasn't retrieved correctly, and the DataFrame is empty, leading to start_price being NaN, but the error message is about Series formatting.

Wait, the error occurs when trying to format the variables in the print statement. For example, if start_price is a Series (like if df['Close'] is a Series and iloc[0] returns a Series, which shouldn't happen), then using {start_price:.2f} would cause this error. But why would df['Close'].iloc[0] be a Series? That doesn't make sense. Unless the DataFrame is structured in a way that 'Close' is a multi-index or something. Alternatively, maybe the code is being run in an environment where the data isn't properly retrieved. For example, if the stock_price function returns an error, but the code proceeds anyway. But the user's code execution failed at the print line, not earlier, so the data must have been retrieved.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the start_price and end_price are pandas Series because of how the data is structured. Let me try to simulate this. Suppose the stock_price function returns a DataFrame where each row is a date, and the columns are 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', etc. Then df['Close'] would be a Series, and iloc[0] would be a scalar. So that's fine. But if the data is not properly parsed, maybe the 'Close' column is a string instead of a float. Then when trying to format, it would throw an error. But the error message is about Series, not string formatting.

Alternatively, maybe the code is using a version of pandas where iloc on a Series returns a Series instead of a scalar. But that's unlikely. Another possibility: the code is using a DataFrame where the index is a DatetimeIndex, and after reset_index(), the 'Date' becomes a column. But that shouldn't affect the 'Close' column's data type.

Wait, perhaps the stock_price function returns data where the 'Close' is a list or another structure. For example, if each entry in nvda_data is a dictionary with 'Close' as a list, then df['Close'] would contain lists, and iloc[0] would be a list. Then trying to format that would cause an error. But that's unlikely. The stock_price function is supposed to return historical data, which should have scalar values per day.

Hmm. Maybe the user's code is correct, but the data wasn't retrieved properly. For example, if the start_date is too recent and there's no data available, the DataFrame would be empty, and accessing iloc[0] would cause an error. But the error message is about the print statement, not about index errors. So perhaps the data was retrieved, but one of the variables is a Series. Let's check the variables:

start_price = df['Close'].iloc[0]
end_price = df['Close'].iloc[-1]

If df['Close'] is a Series, then these should be scalars. Unless the DataFrame is empty, but then iloc would throw an error. So maybe the problem is elsewhere. Let's look at the calculation of monthly_change:

monthly_change = ((end_price - start_price)/start_price * 100).round(2)

If start_price is zero, division by zero, but that's unlikely for a stock price. Alternatively, if start_price or end_price is NaN, then monthly_change would be NaN, and trying to format that could cause issues. But the error is about Series formatting, not NaN.

Wait, the error message specifically mentions that the format string is passed to a Series. So one of the variables in the print statement is a Series. Let's check each variable:

start_price: df['Close'].iloc[0] â†’ scalar
end_price: df['Close'].iloc[-1] â†’ scalar
monthly_change: calculated from scalars â†’ scalar
high: df['High'].max() â†’ scalar
low: df['Low'].min() â†’ scalar
volatility: df['Daily Return'].std() â†’ scalar

All of these should be scalars. Unless, for example, df['High'] is a Series of lists, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the stock_price function returns data in a different structure. For example, if the data is in a MultiIndex, but that's not typical for yfinance.

Wait, maybe the problem is with the 'Daily Return' calculation. Let's see:

df['Daily Return'] = df['Close'].pct_change() * 100

If df['Close'] has any NaN values, pct_change would result in NaNs, but the std() function would ignore them by default. But volatility is calculated as the std of 'Daily Return', which should be a scalar.

Alternatively, maybe the code is being run in a context where the variables are not properly defined. For example, if the stock_price function returns an empty DataFrame, then df would be empty, and accessing iloc[0] would throw an error. But the user's error is during the print statement, not during data retrieval. So the data must have been retrieved successfully.

Wait, perhaps the dates are incorrect. For example, if the user is running this code in 2023, but the end_date is in the future (like October 10, 2023, when today is earlier than that), the stock_price function might return data up to the current date, but the code's print statement refers to 2023-10-10. However, the error is not about the dates but about the formatting.

Alternatively, maybe the data retrieved has a different structure. Let me think: when using yfinance, the stock_price function probably returns a DataFrame with columns like 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', etc. So when converting to a DataFrame, those columns should be present. The code uses df['Close'], which should be a column of floats.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the code is using a pandas Series with an index, and when they try to format it, it's treating

### Test Case 5

**Query:** Which tech company has the highest P/E ratio: Apple, Microsoft, or Google?

**Thinking Process:**
Okay, I need to figure out which of Apple, Microsoft, or Google has the highest P/E ratio. Let me start by recalling what the P/E ratio is. The P/E ratio is the price-to-earnings ratio, calculated by dividing the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS). So, to find this, I need two pieces of information for each company: the current stock price and the EPS.

First, I can get the current stock price using the stock_price tool. Since the P/E ratio is based on the most recent data, I should use the latest available price. For the EPS, I can look at the company's financials, specifically the income statement. The EPS is usually found in the income statement, and for the trailing P/E ratio, I should use the trailing twelve months (TTM) EPS or the most recent annual data.

Wait, the company_financials tool allows me to fetch income statements with period 'annual' or 'quarterly'. If I get the annual income statement, the latest year's EPS would be there. But if the company has released more recent quarterly results, maybe the TTM EPS would be more accurate. However, combining quarterly data might be more complex. Since the user is asking for the current P/E ratio, which typically uses the trailing twelve months earnings, perhaps using the latest four quarters would be better. But the tool might not aggregate that. Alternatively, maybe the annual data is sufficient if the latest annual report is recent enough.

Alternatively, maybe the EPS can be calculated using the net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. So, if I can get the net income from the income statement and the shares outstanding from the balance sheet, I can compute EPS as net income / shares. But that might be more accurate if the financials don't directly report EPS.

Wait, the income statement from yfinance might include 'Diluted EPS' as a line item. Let me check. For example, if I call company_financials for Apple with statement_type 'income' and period 'annual', the resulting dataframe might have a row for 'Diluted EPS'. If that's available, then I can directly use that. Otherwise, I'll have to calculate it.

So the plan is:

1. For each company (Apple, Microsoft, Google), get the latest stock price.
2. For each company, get the latest annual or trailing twelve months EPS.
3. Calculate P/E ratio as Price / EPS.
4. Compare the three and determine which is highest.

First, let's get the stock prices. The tickers for these companies are AAPL (Apple), MSFT (Microsoft), and GOOG (Google). Wait, actually, Google's parent company is Alphabet Inc., which has tickers GOOG and GOOGL. But the user mentioned Google, so maybe they mean either. However, the two classes of shares (GOOG and GOOGL) have similar prices and financials, so perhaps using GOOG is acceptable.

So, for each ticker (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG), I need to get the latest closing price. Using the stock_price tool with a recent end_date, maybe today's date, but since the market might be closed today, perhaps using the last available data. The interval can be '1d' for daily.

Then, for each company, get the financials. Let's start with the income statement. For example, for AAPL:

company_financials('AAPL', 'income', 'annual') would give the annual income statements. The latest year's data would be the most recent. The EPS (diluted) might be a line item there. Similarly for the others.

Alternatively, if the annual data is outdated (e.g., if the latest annual report is from 2022 but we have quarterly data for 2023), then using the quarterly data and summing the last four quarters might be better. But that requires fetching multiple quarters and adding them up, which could be more involved.

But given the tools available, perhaps the annual data is sufficient. Let's proceed with that.

Once I have the EPS from the latest annual report, and the current stock price, compute P/E ratio.

Wait, but the P/E ratio can be trailing (based on past earnings) or forward (based on estimates). The user is asking for the current P/E, which is typically the trailing P/E. So using the latest annual EPS is appropriate if the annual report is recent. However, if the company has already released quarterly reports after the annual report, the TTM EPS would be more accurate. For example, if the annual report is for 2022, but we have Q1, Q2, Q3 2023 data, then TTM would be Q4 2022 + Q1-Q3 2023. But without knowing the timing, this could be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the tool's company_financials for quarterly periods can provide the latest four quarters. Let's check.

For example, if I get the quarterly income statement for a company, the latest four quarters' net income can be summed to get TTM net income. Then, get the latest shares outstanding from the balance sheet (quarterly) to compute TTM EPS.

But this requires more steps. Let's outline the steps for each company:

For each ticker:

1. Get the latest stock price (using stock_price with end_date as today, interval '1d', and take the last 'Close' price).
2. Get the quarterly income statements for the last four quarters.
   - Sum the 'Net Income' from each of the last four quarters to get TTM net income.
3. Get the latest quarterly balance sheet to find the weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) for the TTM period.
   - Or, perhaps take the average of the shares outstanding over the four quarters?
   - Alternatively, use the latest shares outstanding figure.
   - This part might be tricky. The EPS is calculated as Net Income / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding. If the shares outstanding change over the quarters, the weighted average would be needed. However, getting the exact weighted average might not be straightforward from the data available. Alternatively, if the company_financials provides the 'Diluted EPS' directly in the income statement, then we can sum the EPS for the last four quarters? Wait, no. EPS is per quarter, so summing them would give the annualized EPS. Wait, no. If each quarter's EPS is for that quarter, then summing four quarters would give the annual EPS. But if the income statement provides the EPS for the quarter, then adding them up would give the TTM EPS.

But this depends on how the data is presented. For example, if the quarterly income statement includes 'Diluted EPS' as a line item, then summing the last four quarters' Diluted EPS would give the TTM Diluted EPS. Then, the P/E ratio would be current price divided by TTM Diluted EPS.

Alternatively, if the annual income statement has the Diluted EPS for the entire year, and the latest annual report is recent (e.g., as of the end of 2023), then using that might be sufficient. But if the annual report is from a year ago, then the TTM would be better.

Given that the current date is 2023-10-05 (assuming the current date is around here), companies like Apple have their fiscal year ending in September. So their annual report for 2023 might be available. Microsoft's fiscal year ends in June, so their 2023 annual report would be available. Alphabet's fiscal year ends in December, so their 2022 annual report is the latest, and quarterly reports for 2023 would be available.

Therefore, for companies whose fiscal year hasn't ended recently, using quarterly data to compute TTM EPS would be more accurate.

This complicates things. To handle this accurately, perhaps the best approach is:

For each company:

1. Get the latest stock price.
2. Get the quarterly income statements for the last four quarters.
3. Sum the net income from those four quarters to get TTM net income.
4. Get the shares outstanding from the latest balance sheet (quarterly) to compute TTM EPS as TTM net income / shares outstanding.
   - Wait, but shares outstanding can vary each quarter. The correct way is to use the weighted average shares for each quarter and sum the net income, then divide by the weighted average shares for the TTM period. But this might be too involved.

Alternatively, if the company's financials provide the diluted EPS for each quarter, then summing those four quarters' diluted EPS would give the TTM diluted EPS. Then, P/E ratio is current price divided by that sum.

But I need to check if the quarterly income statements include diluted EPS. Let's take an example.

For Apple (AAPL), using company_financials('AAPL', 'income', 'quarterly'), the resulting dataframe might have a row for 'Diluted EPS'. If that's the case, then taking the last four quarters' Diluted EPS and summing them would give the TTM Diluted EPS.

Similarly for Microsoft and Google.

So, the steps would be:

For each ticker (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG):

1. Fetch the latest stock price.
2. Fetch the quarterly income statements.
3. Extract the 'Diluted EPS' for the last four quarters.
4. Sum those four values to get TTM EPS.
5. Compute P/E ratio as (Stock Price) / (TTM EPS).

If 'Diluted EPS' is not available in the quarterly income statements, then we need to calculate it using net income and shares outstanding.

Alternatively, if the annual income statement's latest report is recent enough (e.g., within the last 12 months), then using the annual Diluted EPS might be
